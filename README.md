Some bugs I found
--------------------------
### üíª Desktop 
(Mac, Chrome)  

Note: This is not a formal bug report, so some of the details are not going to be here.

#### üõçÔ∏è 1. Integration with PayPal payment is not working.

I put several items into the shopping cart and was going through the checkout process.  
I selected PayPal as a payment method.  
It successfully connected to PayPal and was working as expected until it was done with the PayPal part.  
I expected to see the "Submit Order" button, but instead it showed me a PayPal button again as if I never went through that step. So I
wasn't able to pay via PayPal even though this platform claimed that they accept PayPal.  
I didn't have a credit card in my hands, that's why I selected PayPal.  
I decided that the items I was going to order are not a necessity and ended up not ordering them, so they just lost a sale.

#### ü§ñ 2. App shows my real first and last name instead of my username.

This is an educational app for kids. I am an adult and a software tester, so I see these kind of things, but kids might not notice.


I filled out First Name, Last Name and Username fields. 

My username is regina_23.  

I navigate away and play a specific game, Magma Mountain.  

The app displays my First and Last Name instead of my Username. Here I use Tester as my Last name, but I actually registered with my real name and the app was displaying my real name which I don't want to be shared.

Yes, I did save it.

#### üëæ 3. Same educational app for kids who want to learn programming languages. It does not deal with switching between programming languages in the middle of the game well.  
Java is available only based on subscription which is about $10/ month while Python and some other languages are free. The consept itself is quite interesting.

If I select Python in the beginning of the game, start playing and then select Java it would show a warning message (which is not user friendly). Also there would be mistakes in the script (such as a semicolon at the end of a line in Python, but not in Java).

#### üëú üí≥ 4. e-Commerce. 

#### "Submit a help request to the seller" page does not accept my photo of the product, and there is no explanation why. The warning message is not user-friendly.

I received the wrong item (I ordered a watercolor brush size 2, but received a brush size 4 instead).

I need to upload a photo to show that I received the wrong item.

I am trying to upload a photo that I took with my cellphone (iPhone).

I am getting the message: "Hmm. Something went wrong. Please try again." There is no explanation.
What kind of photos are OK to submit? Is format a problem? I am trying to submit a HEIC file.
If this site cannot accept certain file formats or large files, etc., it should let the user know.

I tried several things, but nothing worked for me. I ended up taking a screenshot of my photo, and only after that was I able to click the Send button.
As a user, I got very frustrated. I want to get help with my order, not play a guessing game.
This bug has been there for at least half a year.

### üì±Ô∏è Mobile

#### üõçÔ∏è There is a problem with the layout. In portrait mode, it is displaying color selection on top of the text. In landscape mode, everything looks fine.
