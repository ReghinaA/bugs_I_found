Some bugs I found
--------------------------
### 💻 Desktop 
(Mac, Chrome)  

Note: This is not a formal bug report, so some of the details are not going to be here.


#### 🤖 1. App shows my real first and last name instead of my username. This is an educational app for kids. I am an adult and a software tester, so I see these kind of things, but kids might not notice.

I filled out First Name, Last Name and Username fields. 

My username is regina_23.  

I navigate away and play a specific game, Magma Mountain.  

The app displays my First and Last Name instead of my Username. Here I use Tester as my Last name, but I actually registered with my real name and the app was displaying my real name which I don't want to be shared.

Yes, I did save it.

#### 👾 2. Same educational app for kids who want to learn programming languages. It does not deal with switching between programming languages in the middle of the game well.  
Java is available only based on subscription which is about $10/ month while Python and some other languages are free. The consept itself is quite interesting.

If I select Python in the beginning of the game, start playing and then select Java it would show a warning message (which is not user friendly). Also there would be mistakes in the script (such as a semicolon at the end of a line in Python, but not in Java).

#### 🛍️ There is a problem with the layout. In portrait mode, it is displaying color selection on top of the text. In landscape mode, everything looks fine.
